👨‍💻 I'm a 26-year-old PhD student at the University of Cambridge, where I use **computational image analysis**, **machine learning**, and **statistics** to study problems in healthcare. You can check out my research work [here](/publications).

🎓 I previously earned degrees from the University of Oxford (MSc in Radiation Biology, 2020) and University College London (BEng in Biomedical Engineering, 2019), which makes me a scientist-engineer by training—_I think?!_

🎨 I also do a lot of **digital and graphic design** work, including creating videos, books, posters, and infographics. See samples of my work [here](/portfolio).

I recently created '#ExplainToMe', a three-episode animated video series that spotlights the Turing-Roche partnership’s three research themes. Each video breaks down an important concept in health data science, and this project marked my first attempt at animation! Watch them below!👇
